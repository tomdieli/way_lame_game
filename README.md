# The Way Lame Game

Welcome to the Way Lame Game!

Back in the summer of '19, i had some free time on my hands. I had just been working on some django stuff so I attempted to do a django project that would provide a rest API for a combat game.

Eventually, I had to attempt some kind of user interface. I decided to use React, and the result is...pretty lame.

So, the outer game will be to make this game less lame. This will include:
* Using one or more alternate front ends(web/mobile)
* Determining the proper role of the backend, or if it even makes sense to use.
* Adding a bit of style to the UI. It looks like junk.
* Adding more state management to the fron-end components. It plays like junk.
* Actually make it multiplayer.
